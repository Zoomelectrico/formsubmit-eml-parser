# FormSubmit Eml Parser

This is a super simple script using es2017+ that uses [eml-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eml-format) to crawl over `.eml` files an rescue email address and write the address to a txt file.

## How to use it

just clone this repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Zoomelectrico/formsubmit-eml-parser.git
```

then cd into the folder and install dependencies

```shell
cd formsubmit-eml-parser && npm install
```

then just copy the `.eml` files into the `files` folder and the run `npm start` and voila.
